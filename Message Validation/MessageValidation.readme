A message is considered as valis id:

* Every opening bracket is followed by its corresponding closing brackets includes[] () {}
* Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
* Open brackets must be closed in the same order.
* The message should not contain any other characters other than upper and lower case alphabets, digits from 0 to   9, and opening and closing brakcets mentioned above.

Write a programme to check if the given String is Valid. If the String is Valid return True else False.

If it is false, then return the index at which the initial mistake occures.

If the String is Valid return the lase index.

If the String is invalid due to brackets that are not closed, return the length of the message.

The index starts at 0.

Output format ->[Boolean, Index]

Sample input:
Input : (788362[)]
Output : [False, 8]

Input: (54)[str]
Output : [True, 8]

Input: [{(abc)}]
Output: [True, 8]
